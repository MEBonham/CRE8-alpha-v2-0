            <p>Here are a few popular fantasy character archetypes, and a recommended demonstration of how to build them in CRE8. A few choices will be left up to you to make your character feel individual, but most of your choices are provided.</p>
            <p>Feel free to deviate from these "recommended" builds as soon as you feel comfortable enough with the system to do so!</p>
            <section>
                <h2>Fighter</h2>
                <h3>Level 1</h3>
                <p>Follow the selection choices made on the <Link to="/characters/prebuiltfighter">PreBuilt Fighter</Link> character sheet up to Level 1. Note that you don't yet qualify for the XP Parcel under Soldier for "Stealth 4 ranks."</p>
                <p>For your first Kit, make a choice to represent your character's race: Dwarf, Elf, Halfling, Human Paragon, or Orc. If you picked Human Paragon, choose Rhino's Charge as your bonus Feat. You may also have to choose bonus Skill Ranks as you gain XP Parcels, but you should be able to choose any Skills you like (that are not already maxxed out) and have your build be legal. If you picked Orc, change your Initial Trained Skill from Brawn to Nature. If you picked Elf, note that you already qualify for the XP Parcel "Martial Proficiency talent."</p>
                <p>For your first Talent, choose something to represent what your character did before adventuring: Artisan, Engineering, Farmer, or Sailor. If you chose Artisan, select any specialty under that Talent. If you are a Dwarf, note that the Engineering talent or certain Artisan specialties will qualify you for an XP Parcel.</p>
                <p>For your last skill rank for this level, choose Knowledge if you chose the Engineering talent, or Nature otherwise.</p>
                <p>Your most important equipment to buy is an Arming Sword and a Full Shield (proficient), and either Leather Armor or Chainmail (proficient). If you were lucky with your Wealth rolls or the GM allows you to pick up more equipment for free, consider items from the Classic Adventuring Gear bundle, or a Shortbow, Quiver, and some Arrows.</p>
                <p>Don't forget to tell your character sheet that you are Wearing your clothing and armor, and Wielding your Full Shield and Arming Sword. Put most of your other Equipment in a Backpack or Pouches.</p>
